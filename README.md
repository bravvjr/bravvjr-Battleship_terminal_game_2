Gameplay

The game will tell you if your shot is a hit or miss.
Sinking all parts of a ship removes it from the opponentâ€™s fleet.
Computerâ€™s Turn:

The computer fires back using a mix of random shots and smart targeting when it scores a hit.
**Visual Feedback**:

Your board shows your ships and the computer's hits.
The opponent's board (computer) reveals hits and misses but hides ship locations.
**Winning the Game**
The game ends when one player sinks all the opponent's ships. If your fleet is destroyed, the computer wins. If you sink all the computerâ€™s ships, you win!
**Additional Features**
Smart AI: The computer uses a strategy to target adjacent cells after scoring a hit.
Grid Reference: Rows are labeled A, B, C, etc., and columns are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.
Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win! ðŸŽ¯
